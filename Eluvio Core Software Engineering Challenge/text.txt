Planning
Suffix Array + LCP Approach to this
Notes:
	255 alphabet size (possible values of one Byte)
	Must note where it occurs in all files
	Result must be found in atleast two files
Create Suffix Array using SA-IS
	*How to separate between files?
		Separate file inputs using a separator in suffix array?
		How does induced sorting and LCP change?
	Offset should be its location in file
	Can use fin and seekg to instead of storing the full file in memory for offset lookup
	Create S_TYPE/L_TYPE and Bucketsize at the same time when reading in file data
Construct LCP Array using Kasher's algorithim
	*Special Rules
		resulting prefix found in atleast two files
			return offset + file location
	Don't have to look in source file of the current prefix?

What to do when doing Unique Sentinel Characters
	When comparing source[i], check if it is sentinel
	Bucket tails/heads should have indexes for each sentinel character
		should be done before moving on to other characters
